The basic UART based application on FPGA through PMOD BLE by implementation and
interfacing have been performed.
➢ The wireless Bluetooth communication has been established between the FPGA (Basys3) and other modules which are - PC & Mobile.
➢ The data rate of the receiving data is faster and more efficient when compared to the
previous modules of the same application.
➢ The main achievement we obtain from using BLE module in place of the older Bluetooth
communicating modules is the power consumption. BLE acquires very low power when
compared to that of the earlier used modules.
➢ It is easy to discover and obtain a connection with other modules and the compatibility
with smart phones.
➢ Easy to integrate these PMOD BLE modules especially for the UART and SPI
communications.
➢ Scalability and Flexibility of implementing this easily in any device without writing the
entire code or implementation in them.
➢ Through the UART communication, we can implement and transfer any kind of logic and
transmit it faster and efficiently using the PMOD BLE.
